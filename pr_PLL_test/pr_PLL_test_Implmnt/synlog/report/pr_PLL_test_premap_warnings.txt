@W: MT531 :"c:\users\raul.lora\documents\asic_bridge\config_register_latched_dec.v":99:2:99:3|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 16 sequential elements including config_register_latched_dec_inst.DYNCNF_1[13:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\raul.lora\documents\asic_bridge\freq_div.v":18:4:18:9|Found inferred clock ASIC_bridge_top|CLK which controls 36 sequential elements including divisor_inst.counter[1:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\raul.lora\documents\asic_bridge\config_register_latched_dec.v":62:1:62:6|Found inferred clock ASIC_bridge_top|clk_output_inferred_clock which controls 104 sequential elements including config_register_latched_dec_inst.STATSR[87:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
